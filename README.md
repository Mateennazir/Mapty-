Mapty App -- Map your workouts

I have finised building this Mapty after learning Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript from Jonas Schmedtmann's course.

Features might be added:

    Ability to edit a workout
    Ability to sort workouts by a certain field (e.g. distance)
    Re-build Running and Cycling objects coming from Local Storage
    More realistic error and confirmation messages
    Ability to position the map to show all workouts
    Ability to draw lines and shapes instead of just points [very hard]
    Geocode location from coordinates [asynchronous JavaScript]
    Display weather data for workout time and place [asynchronous JavaScript]

Built with

    CSS custom properties
    Javascript
    Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
